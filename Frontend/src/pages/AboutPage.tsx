                    <h2>Why did I develop this page?</h2>
                    <br />
                    <p>The page was developed in response to the need that arose when carrying out a language exchange dynamic. 
                        I met Rahmah in December 2024. She was looking to learn Spanish and I was looking to learn English. 
                        In addition to meeting on Discord three times a week, we usually chat on WhatsApp. In this exchange 
                        of messages and audios on WhatsApp, and faced with the need to have transcriptions of the audios, 
                        I searched for code that could do this. So, I found a Python repository 
                        (https://gist.github.com/jvanyom/1695ae4b5246fa0c28cbd81c4b047a2c) that could transcribe the audios 
                        to text and with a wide variety of supported languages. But the program works through a terminal. 
                        So I thought about bringing it to a website so that my friend Rahmah, who lives in the United States, 
                        can also access and transcribe the audios I send her into Spanish. That's how I developed 
                        this page with an entirely educational purpose, both to learn more about React (which I am starting with) 
                        and to learn languages.</p>
